# I launched a super simple random NFT Generator :)

Check out the Contract's page on OpenSea where you can see the collection as it currently stands: https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/threerandomwords-4fk8jlvvrl

Here is a link to the front-end where you can, connect your wallet and generate your own. But hurry up, total supply is just 50! https://nft-starter-project-1.azizmosbah.repl.co/

Everything is completely free as it is happening on the ETH rinkeby test network :)


  1.  Get Metamask & set it on the rinkeby network
  2.  Ask for ETH on this faucet: https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby
  3.  Once your wallet is loaded you can tvveet :D
